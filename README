Make sure you have OpenGL and GLEW (in -dev version).
GL and GLEW headers should be in /usr/include/GL/
To compile example you will also need sdl bindings from: http://github.com/banthar/Go-SDL

To install type:
	make install

To import, use the following:
	import "gl/gl10"

If you want advenced functionality like shaders, buffers use the following:
	import "gl/gl20"

Before calling any gl function call gl.Init() that will use GLEW to initialize all opengl functions.
