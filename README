Make sure you have OpenGL (in -dev version).
GL headers should be in /usr/include/GL/
To compile example you will also need sdl bindings from: http://github.com/banthar/Go-SDL

To install type:
	make install

If you want advenced functionality like shaders & buffers, type:
	make install-gl20

To install both, type:
	make install-all

To import, use the following:
	import "gl"

To import advenced functionality like shaders & buffers, use the following instead:
	import "gl/gl20"

For the backwards-compatible GLU bindings, use the following:
	import "glu"

For the newer, better bindings, use the following:
	import "gl/glu"
